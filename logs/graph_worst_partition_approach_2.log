00:39:00 | (Iteration 1) Upper bound obtained: 33.0
00:39:00 | (Iteration 1) Building new partitions and link matrices.
Number of worst partition 1
00:39:04 | (Iteration 1) 2 partitions built.
00:39:04 | (Iteration 1) 4 point(s) available to compute lower bound.
00:39:04 | (Iteration 1) Lower bound find with relax Maybe 31.0
00:39:04 | (Iteration 1) Solving lower bound model.
00:39:05 | (Iteration 1) Lower bound obtained: 33.0
